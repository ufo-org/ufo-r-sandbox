Description:
  This is an full R frontend for creating lazily populated larger-than-memory R
  objects. When an object is created, it is empty, and its contents are loaded
  into memory when it is interacted with. This causes a custom R function to be
  executed to generate the data needed to populate it. The populate functions
  execute in a separate sanbox R process.
